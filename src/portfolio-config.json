One of the ways we did this was by implementing an animation toggle, seen in the 'Gender pay gap' scrolly project previously. It was taken further this time - starting and stopping animations on multiple different elements using event emitters. We also synced it to the ‘prefers reduced motion’ option on user's devices - so if this is enabled, animations would automatically be disabled.",
            "The project was translated into approximately 27 different languages. This meant it would be accessed by people all over the world, on different devices, connections and with differing amounts of data available. Therefore, we had to be mindful of performance. We did this in a variety of ways - from making sure all the images were optimised and lazy loaded, to chunking all the data for each city into individual files.",
            "Another way we optimised the project was to create a great no javascript experience. All the main text content was still available, apart from the personalised city results. The interactive elements had some sort of fallback, and a message to upgrade your browser for the full experience. We also made sure that the lazy loaded images would still be visible if a user had disabled js using the noscript tags.",

We could then format the resulting dataset how we needed for each product and output it as separate JSON files locally to the project.",
            "I developed an auto deployment strategy, so the poll tracker could be updated out of hours without the need for a developer. </br> I used an AWS Lambda, running every minute, to check the data against a local copy to see if it had been updated. If it had, it would then trigger a Jenkins job. Jenkins would build the project, run the data formatting tasks and generate an updated screenshot for the fallback content. I configured it to notify a Slack channel with it's progress - particularly focussing on descriptive erorr messages. This would allow the journalists to know if something went wrong. If it was successful, Jenkins would then deploy the project.",

We didn’t want people feeling overwhelmed or nauseated by our exciting new scrolly, so to cater to users with vestibular impairments, or those who just don’t like animation, I implemented a toggle at the beginning of the article.
