An element of personalisation is added to the website by encouraging users to log in with their Spotify account to see how their favourite songs compare with those that have reached number 1.",

The website was built with JavaScript, Scrollama, D3, the Spotify Web API library as well as Webpack and Gulp. Unit tests were written for the site using Mocha and Chai, and further tests were conducted using Ruby & Cucumber."
