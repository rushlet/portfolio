        	                              This was an in depth project looking at how climate change is predicted to impact temperatures in cities around the world.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              I worked closely with our trainee developer, mentoring and learning from him throughout the process. We built the project using Handlebars, SASS, JS(ES6), Three.js and D3.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              He was responsible for creating and optimising the globe using Three.js, whilst I concentrated on the scrolly chart section. I adapted the Pudding's Scrollama library to work with our bespoke internal scaffold, and gracefully degrade for older browsers (such as IE11). I built the chart using D3, with events to sync it up to the scrolly.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              We concentrated on accessibility, making sure everybody would be able to engage with and enjoy the project. One of the ways we did this was by implementing an animation toggle, seen in the 'Gender pay gap' scrolly project previously. It was taken further this time - starting and stopping animations on multiple different elements using event emitters. We also synced it to the ‘prefers reduced motion’ option on user's devices - so if this is enabled, animations would automatically be disabled.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              The project was translated into approximately 27 different languages. This meant it would be accessed by people all over the world, on different devices, connections and with differing amounts of data available. Therefore, we had to be mindful of performance. We did this in a variety of ways - from making sure all the images were optimised and lazy loaded, to chunking all the data for each city into individual files.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              Another way we optimised the project was to create a great no javascript experience. All the main text content was still available, apart from the personalised city results. The interactive elements had some sort of fallback, and a message to upgrade your browser for the full experience. We also made sure that the lazy loaded images would still be visible if a user had disabled js using the noscript tags.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              The project was a great success, seen by over 1.2 million people in the first 3 days and longlisted for an Kantar Information is Beautiful award.

        	                              A project showing how each of the UK political parties are performing in the polls, built using JS (ES6), D3, Handlebars and Sass.

        	                            <p>
        	                              I focused more effort on the back-end of this project than we usually do for Visual Journalism projects.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              For the core content / fallback, we decided to output a screenshot of the graph, to give users as full an experience as possible. I wrote a Node script to use Puppeteer to go to the project, take a screenshot of the graph at different viewport dimensions and save these locally. They are then pulled in as a fallback image for the graph.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              We have one large dataset powering the three visual products on the page (the chart, the pictogram and the table of polls). This needs to be transformed and manipulated differently for each product. I worked with the data team to help them write JavaScript to filter and manipulate the data, which we could then run as a Node script during the build process. We could then format the resulting dataset how we needed for each product and output it as separate JSON files locally to the project.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              We developed an auto deployment strategy, so the poll tracker could be updated out of hours without the need for a developer. </br> I used an AWS Lambda, running every minute, to check the data against a local copy to see if it had been updated. If it had, it would then trigger a Jenkins job. Jenkins would build the project, run the data formatting tasks and generate an updated screenshot for the fallback content. I configured it to notify a Slack channel with it's progress - particularly focussing on descriptive erorr messages. This would allow the journalists to know if something went wrong. If it was successful, Jenkins would then deploy the project.
        	                            </p>
        	                            <p>
        	                              We wrote some unit tests to accompany this data formatting to make sure the data being pulled in and being outputted was how we expected it to be formatted and the values were within expected ranges. This was especially important because the auto deployment solution meant less manual checking / testing than when a project is usually updated.

        	                              This was an ambitious project experimenting with scrollytelling. The first big challenge was trying to visualise the dataset. We wanted to render a dot representing each company in the dataset, and animate these inline with the text. There were over 10,000 companies in the data, which is no small feat to render on a page. We managed to do this using REGL (based on WebGL) and D3.

        	                            <p>
        	                              I spent a lot of time making sure it was inclusive and accessible, this meant considering things like how users could interact with it using only a keyboard, or a screenreader. I read about accessibility considerations in scrollytelling and animated content, and found one particular article of great help. We didn’t want people feeling overwhelmed or nauseated by our exciting new scrolly, so to cater to users with vestibular impairments, or those who just don’t like animation, I implemented a toggle at the beginning of the article. This was accompanied by a trigger warning - notifying users that this article contained animation and offering them an option upfront to stop that, without taking the content away from them.

        	                              I took part in NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019, with two friends. We decided to tackle the 'Art side of the moon' challenge, 'to create an artistic work to communicate, inform, or inspire others about humanity’s return to the moon'.

        	                            <p>
        	                              By combining the atmospheric aesthetic of space with the intricacies of sound, we wanted to capture people’s imagination, in order to inspire and educate about NASA’s past, present and future. We created an immersive 360 experience, available online and as VR. Visuals were created using NASA models, textures and our own artwork, accompanied by a piece of music we wrote which takes vocal clips to tell the story of our relationship with moon and space; from the launch of Apollo 11 to the plans for the first woman on the moon by 2024.

        	                              Rather than acting as a developer, this track is what I concentrated on creating. I used GarageBand to write the music, which is built up with instrumental tracks I wrote combined with curious space sounds available from the NASA audio library. I layered these with the different voice clips we had found to create an engaging and educational piece of music.

        	                              The project showcases the climate impact of the foods we eat. The user can select a food from our list and indicate how often they eat it. They are then shown how their choices impact the environment, putting emissions into context by comparing them to flights or water usage to showers. A graph is displayed comparing the food to similar items, and the user can select another item from a random selection on the shelf at the bottom of the interactive.

I took primary responsibility for the styling and accessibility of the project. This included making sure the 'choose another item' section met the designers specifications whilst also being usable for keyboard only users or those using screen readers to access the article.

It is a drag and drop game, featuring animations and quotes from readers. When an item is binned you can choose to read more about the history of it and its relationship with female oppression. It was translated into 25 languages.

This was easier said than done, as mental health is funded slightly differently and therefore data is recorded differently, and different terminology is used. As part of this project, I was mentoring two junior developers. This involved pairing with them on certain aspects, assigning them their own tasks, being on hand to talk through any issues and provide code reviews. This was a challenge whilst juggling my own workload, but I received positive feedback from everybody involved.

        	                              I was co-developer on this interactive map and calculator. I worked primarily on the map section of the page - where users can type in their postcode or click an area on the map to see how it scored. This involved making our existing tile map work with new data and geojson, as well as adjusting the map controls for improved usability. I built and styled the results panel, making sure it was as accessible as possible in the time available.

        	                              The game can 1 - 4 players, the remaining players are controlled using artificial intelligence. When a game is started one player is the hero, whose mission is to collect as many coins as possible before time runs out. The other players are ghosts who aim to catch the hero. Once a ghost catches the hero, they become the hero and can now start collecting coins and gaining points. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game. There are mystery power ups and power downs along the way - which may temporarily double or half points gained or the speed you can move at.

It was very popular, and technically is one of our best examples of progressive enhancement. It was built to be accessible and reusable - and Becky was so ahead of the deadline that she was able to write integration tests for it using Ruby and Cucumber.</blockquote>

        	                              This was the first big project I helped develop whilst working in Visual Journalism at BBC News. I was part of a small team including a journalist, designer, project manager and another developer. I worked closely with the more senior developer to create this interactive feature; a global data project, published in over 20 languages on the BBC News website which compared the user to 180 world leaders on factors such as age and education.

        	                              I was responsible for building and implementing the graphs, charts and slow reveal using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also took on styling the page for right to left reading languages and inserting SVGs created by our dedicated designer. We worked together with a tester to find issues with the interactive displaying across various devices and browsers and fix as many as possible before the go-live date. It was a tense and exciting project in which I learnt a lot. I have written a blog post on the experience, if you would like to find out more.

        	                              For this project, we were using a content framework built by one of the senior developers in our team. This was one of the first projects we had used it for, so we were still getting to grips with it. We created components which make up the article - such as a video, an image or a quote section - with Handlebars, JavaScript and SASS and released them via our NPM repo. This allowed us to easily install them and adapt them for our specific use cases. I took responsibility for ensuring that users accessing the story from older browsers (such as IE8), or with JavaScript turned off, would still have an engaging experience - with as many assets working as possible. I also wrote a few grunt scripts to handle various tasks we needed to cover in the process.

        	                              Kemp Town Carnival is a Brighton based free community event. I was asked to redesign the existing WordPress site, to make it easier for the team to update and to make it more aesthetically engaging for users visiting the site. I worked closesly with Mat, the organiser, alongside a designer and digital marketer, to discuss how we felt the site should be laid out.

        	                              I had a very short period of time to build the new site, so I opted to use the existing WordPress site but change the theme, add a variety of plugins and write a significant amount of custom CSS and JavaScript. The team were very pleased with the website I produced, which included all the features we had wanted initially - a latest news page, a 'subscribe to newsletter' widget and a design which is unified with other products associated with the event.

        	                              I worked closely with Liz over an extended period of time to build a simple website to promote her holiday romance novels and showcase blog posts.

        	                            <p>
        	                              I opted to build the site using WordPress to allow Liz to later update it easily for herself - adding blog posts and new books. To make it bespoke to Liz's ideas of how she wanted it to look, I adapted an existing theme with a significant amount of custom CSS and JavaScript.

        	                              I worked closely with a BBC Journalist to create this article page about a study released on the effect of climate change on coffee production. I built the page using our team's internal content framework, which involved writing code in Handlebars, SASS and JavaScript.

        	                              One interesting challenge with this project was that it used content that was under embargo. This meant we couldn't build or test it with the final assets or translations (it was being released in 10 languages). Although this was potentially problematic, we successfully used palceholder assets and text until the embargo deadline and then worked quickly to replace the content, re-test it and publish the article.

        	                              Don’t Panic is an Endless Runner style game, inspired by ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’, designed to be played on desktop or mobile. The user plays as a rocket, using arrow keys or by pressing on the side of the screen to travel towards to navigate through outer space - avoiding alien abductions and collecting coins. The player is armed with a Random Reassignment Button - inspired by Douglas Adams’ Infinite Improbability Drive (though with far less possibilities) when it's ready to be activated, it will appear in the bottom right hand corner. Clicking on it could trigger regeneration into a different galaxy or maybe even the spontaneous apparition of a bowl of flowers.

        	                              This was a website I worked on for a client, Elsie, who was doing her PhD. She wanted a portfolio to showcase the different outreach work she had been doing, teaching young people about sexual health.

        	                              I was given creative freedom, though worked closely with Elsie to discuss her ideas and implement them as best I could. I built the website from scratch, in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using the Skeleton framework.
