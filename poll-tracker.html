          <p>A project showing how each of the UK political parties are performing in the polls, built using JS (ES6), D3, Handlebars and Sass.</p>
          <p>I focused more effort on the back-end of this project than we usually do for Visual Journalism projects.</p>
          <p>For the core content / fallback, we decided to output a screenshot of the graph, to give users as full an experience as possible.
            I wrote a Node script to use Puppeteer to go to
            the project, take a screenshot of the graph at different viewport dimensions and save these locally. They are then pulled in as a fallback image for the graph.</p>
          <p>We have one large dataset powering the three visual products on the page (the chart, the pictogram and
            the table of polls). This needs to be transformed and manipulated differently for each product. I worked
            with the data team to help them write JavaScript to filter and manipulate the data, which we could then
            run as a Node script during the build process. We could then format the resulting dataset how we needed for each product
            and output it as separate JSON files locally to the project.</p>
          <p>We developed an auto deployment strategy, so the poll tracker could be updated out of hours without the need for a developer.<br>
            I used an AWS Lambda, running every minute, to check the data against a local copy to see if it had been
            updated.
            If it had, it would then trigger a Jenkins job.<br>
            Jenkins would build the project, run the data formatting tasks and generate an updated screenshot for the fallback content.
            I configured it to notify a Slack channel with it's progress - particularly focussing on descriptive erorr
            messages. This would allow the journalists to know if something went wrong. If it was successful, Jenkins
            would then deploy the project.</p>
          <p>We wrote some unit tests to accompany this data formatting to make sure the data being pulled in
            and being outputted was how we expected it to be formatted and the values were within expected ranges. This
            was especially important because the auto deployment solution meant less manual checking / testing
            than when a project is usually updated.</p>
